# TriangularPrismEncoding
A 6-5 Error correction code. All values have at least a hamming distance of 4, and up to 8. Encoding and decoding, repair up to one error bit per 11 bits, and identify errors of multiple bits with greater precision than hamming 7-4. Each corrupted 11 bits is also easier to trace back to its likely origin.
